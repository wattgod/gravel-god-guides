  "description": "SBT GRVL is Steamboat Springs' premier gravel race, featuring challenging mountain terrain, significant climbing, and the stunning backdrop of the Yampa Valley. The 75-mile course delivers a proper test of fitness with enough distance to require smart pacing and solid fueling.",
  "key_challenges": "sustained climbing at altitude, technical gravel descents, variable weather, and managing effort across 5500ft of elevation gain",
  "recommended_tire_width": "40-45mm",
  "technical_rating": "Moderate-High",
  "time_cutoff": "None",
  "website": "https://www.sbtgrvl.com",
  "weather_strategy": "Mountain weather is unpredictable. Check forecast, pack arm warmers and vest. Morning starts can be cold, afternoon thunderstorms possible.",
  "aid_station_strategy": "Well-supported course. Quick stops for refills. Don't rely solely on aid stations - carry enough between stops.",
  "altitude_power_loss": "Significant - race is at 6,700-8,500 feet elevation. Expect 5-10% power loss vs sea level. Acclimatize if possible.",
  "specific_skill_notes": "Practice descending on loose gravel. The course has technical sections where confidence matters. Train on similar terrain if available.",
  "specific_tactics": "Start conservatively - the altitude will catch up with you. The climbing is relentless so pace yourself. Save legs for the back half.",

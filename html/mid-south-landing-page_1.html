                <li>Tire choice is critical: file tread for dry, aggressive tread for mud</li>
                <li>Consider bringing two wheelsets if possible</li>
                <li>Tubeless setup mandatory—bring sealant and repair kit</li>
                <li>Frame protection tape/old tubes to prevent mud buildup</li>
                <li>Extra bottles—aid stations can be far apart</li>
                <li>Mud-clearing tool (old spoke or zip-tie strap)</li>

                <li>Plan for 60-100g carbs/hour depending on effort</li>

    <!-- The Bottom Line -->
    <div class="bottom-line">
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>The Mid South is gravel's ultimate weather lottery wrapped in elite competition and world-class organization. Bobby Wintle has created something rare: a race that's simultaneously grassroots in spirit and professional in execution. The $100K purse brings the fastest field outside of Unbound, but the 100-mile distance keeps it tactical and exciting rather than a pure survival test.</p>
        
        <p>Here's what makes this race matter: the red clay changes everything. Same course, wildly different race depending on what March decides to throw at you. When it's dry, you're racing at threshold for 4 hours with pack dynamics and tactical positioning. When it rains, you're problem-solving your way through 8-10 hours of mud, traction loss, and equipment management. Both versions are legitimate tests—just different tests.</p>
        
        <p>This isn't a bucket list race you do once and move on. The Mid South rewards coming back, learning the course, understanding the weather patterns, and developing strategies for different scenarios. Veterans who've done it multiple times have a huge advantage because they've seen the various forms this race can take.</p>
        
        <p>The Mid South doesn't care about your FTP if you can't handle sketchy conditions. It doesn't care about your bike handling if you bonk at mile 60. It doesn't care about your tactics if you picked the wrong tires. This is gravel's most honest race because you can't fake any part of the preparation. Every weakness gets exposed. Every strength gets tested. And Mother Nature still gets a vote that might override everything.</p>
        
        <p>If you want predictability, skip this race. If you want perfect weather and guaranteed "hero dirt," look elsewhere. But if you want to test yourself against the best field in gravel, in conditions you can't fully prepare for, on a course that rewards both fitness and adaptability—The Mid South is calling your name. Just don't forget to pack the rain gear and the mud tires. You might not need them. But you'll be glad you brought them.</p>
